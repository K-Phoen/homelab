[Unit]
Description=Blocky

# This unit is supposed to indicate when network functionality is available, but it is only
# very weakly defined what that is supposed to mean, with one exception: at shutdown, a unit
# that is ordered after network-online.target will be stopped before the network
Wants=network-online.target
After=network-online.target
# A target that should be used as synchronization point for all host/network name service lookups.
# All services for which the availability of full host/network name resolution is essential should
# be ordered after this target, but not pull it in.
Wants=nss-lookup.target
Before=nss-lookup.target

# Limit (re)start loop to 5 within 1 minute
